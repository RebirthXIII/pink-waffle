# The battle of Faerun
This is a game engine for "The battle of Faerun", a practical work proposed by Mr. Francis Brunet-Manquat, professor at IUT2 - Grenoble France.

In this game, dwarves and elves are fighting to conquier the opposite castle !

This game is "playable" only in the console. Maybe someone should integrate it with Unity, That would be awsome !
